👋 HI

My name is Florian, currently working  as TwinCAT HMI Product Specialist, working with a full-stack framework in dotnet and javascript. In my free time I like to explore programming and computer science concepts. I like to combine this with my passion for music and 3D art. I am also very interested in Quantum Computing and Information and have written a set of explanatory jupyter notebooks for getting started.

Some projects I am currently working on:

| Name | Description |
| Rust Raytracer | A raytracer based on the description from Raytracing From The Ground Up by Kevin Suffern, implemented in Rust. |
| Python/Rust Lox | An implementation of the Lox example language from Crafting Interpreters bt Robert Nystrom. |
| Quantum Information Basics | A set of notebooks explaining the basic theory and practice behind some popular QI frameworks. |
