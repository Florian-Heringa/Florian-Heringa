👋 HI

My name is Florian, currently working  as TwinCAT HMI Product Specialist, working with a full-stack framework in dotnet and javascript. In my free time I like to explore programming and computer science concepts, which I like to combine with my passion for music and 3D art. I am also very interested in Quantum Computing and Information and am currently writing a set of explanatory jupyter notebooks for getting started.

Some projects I am currently working on:

| Name | Description |
| :-------------  |:-------------         |
| [Rust Raytracer](https://github.com/Florian-Heringa/py-rs-raytracer) | A raytracer based on the description from Raytracing From The Ground Up by Kevin Suffern, implemented in Rust. |
| [Python/Rust Lox](https://github.com/Florian-Heringa/crafting-interpreters) | An implementation of the Lox example language from Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom in Python and Rust. |
| [Quantum Information Basics in Qiskit](https://github.com/Florian-Heringa/quantum-frameworks-python-exploration/tree/main/Python/Qiskit) | A set of notebooks explaining the basic theory and practice behind some popular QI frameworks. Expanded version of tutorials provided by IBM. |
