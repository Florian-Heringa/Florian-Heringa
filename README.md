ðŸ‘‹ HI

My name is Florian, currently working in technical support as TwinCAT HMI Product Specialist where I am learning a lot about web frameworks. I plan to have a bunch of interesting samples available here, so I'd be happy to take suggestions!

Additionally I have an interest in programming in general, music and 3D art. Especially combining these disciplines for various results and reasons is something I really enjoy.

I am currently learning:
- [cmajor](https://github.com/SoundStacks/cmajor)
- [django](https://github.com/django/django)
- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

And always happy to have some constructive discussion or cool collaborations!
